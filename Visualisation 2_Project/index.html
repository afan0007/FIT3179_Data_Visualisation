        <p>The visualisation here illustrates the number of YouTube channels created over the years. 
           From the dataset of Global YouTube Statistics, <br>it is evident that <strong><u>most YouTube channels were first created on the year 2006</u></strong>. 
           In comparison to the number of channels created in the year <strong>2005</strong>, there has been a <strong><u>drastic increase in the number of channels of created</u></strong>. </p>
          <p><br>This shows that between the year <strong>2005-2006</strong>, YouTube has <strong><u>become more well known and used by the public</u></strong>.
          <br>However, from the year <strong>2016</strong>, the number of channels created has gradually decrease. 
          This may be due to the stability of general sets of YouTubers which provide more than enough content for the public in YouTube.

        <p>Now let's dive deeper into understanding the number of YouTube channels created over the years <strong>(Since the year 2006) </strong>by continent.
         <br> From the multi-line chart here, we can see that <strong><u>North America has created an overall greater number of channels over the years</u></strong>.
        followed by <strong>Asia, Europe,South America, Oceania,</strong>and <strong>Africa</strong>.</p>
      <p><br>This supports the fact that the <strong><u>majority of YouTubers are from North America followed by Asia</u></strong>.
        <br>Similar to the previous line chart visualisation,the number of <strong><u>channels created in the year 2016 gradually decrease for all continents</u></strong>. 
        This could be due to the stability of general sets of YouTubers that provide more than enough content for the public on YouTube.   </p>
